<p>Based on the provided financial data, a comprehensive tax-saving strategy for Samuel Will, considering his status as a Non-Resident Alien married filing jointly with two dependents residing in Hilo, Hawaii, cannot be fully constructed.  The information provided is incomplete, particularly regarding annual income and details about his business and real estate holdings which are crucial for accurate tax calculation.  However, a partial strategy can be outlined based on the available data.  A complete analysis requires additional financial information.</p>
<p><strong>1. Investment Strategies for Tax Efficiency:</strong></p>
<p>The current portfolio shows a mix of asset classes.  To optimize tax efficiency, the following strategies should be considered, pending a review of Samuel's annual income and tax bracket:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tax-Advantaged Accounts:</strong>  Explore the contribution limits and tax benefits of available retirement plans (401(k), traditional and Roth IRAs).  Contributions to these accounts reduce taxable income.  The choice between traditional and Roth depends on Samuel's expected tax bracket in retirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tax-Efficient Investing:</strong> Consider adjusting the portfolio allocation based on the tax implications of different asset classes.  For example, the tax rates on capital gains vary by asset. Minimizing short-term capital gains is preferred. Holding assets longer can often result in lower capital gains tax rates.</p>

<p><strong>2. Deductions, Exemptions, and Credits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Federal Deductions:</strong> Without knowing Samuel's annual income, specific deduction amounts cannot be determined.  However, deductions like the standard deduction or itemized deductions (if applicable), and those for dependents will reduce taxable income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Federal Credits:</strong> Several federal credits may be available based on income and family circumstances. A complete analysis is required to establish eligibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Texas Deductions:</strong>  Texas has a simpler tax system than the Federal one; most federal deductions are not applicable to Texas tax returns. Property taxes and certain charitable contributions might be deductible on the Texas state return depending on the amount and the filing status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credits (Federal and Texas):</strong>  The information provided doesn't contain sufficient information to determine eligibility for relevant federal or Texas tax credits (e.g., child tax credit, earned income tax credit).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. State-Specific Tax Optimizations (Texas):</strong></p>
<p>Since Samuel resides in Hawaii, not Texas, Texas-specific tax optimizations are not relevant. Hawaii's tax laws should be considered instead.  Hawaii's tax system should be reviewed to identify deductions, credits and other tax savings strategies specific to the state.</p>
<p><strong>4. Tax-Loss Harvesting Opportunities:</strong></p>
<p>The provided portfolio shows some investments with losses (Gold and Bonds).  Tax-loss harvesting involves selling losing assets to offset capital gains.  This strategy can reduce the overall tax liability.  However, the "wash-sale rule" needs to be considered to avoid penalties.  Consult a tax advisor for strategic tax-loss harvesting within the confines of the applicable regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This analysis is based on limited information.  It is crucial to consult with a qualified tax professional for personalized advice tailored to Samuel Will's specific financial situation, income, and tax residency status.  This response provides a general overview and should not be considered complete or exhaustive tax advice.</p>
