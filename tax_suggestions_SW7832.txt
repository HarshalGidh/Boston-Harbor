<p><strong>2. Deductions, Exemptions, and Credits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Federal Deductions:</strong>  As a Non-Resident Alien, deductions may be limited compared to resident taxpayers. Consult the IRS Publication 519 for details on allowable deductions.  Itemized deductions should be evaluated to determine if they exceed the standard deduction.</li>
<li><strong>Texas Deductions:</strong>  Texas generally follows a simpler tax system with fewer deductions than the federal government.  Consult the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts website for current information on deductions for Non-Resident Aliens.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Credits:</strong>  Explore the possibility of claiming any applicable federal tax credits.  Depending on family circumstances, the child tax credit may be partially applicable.  Consult the IRS website for details on available credits for Non-Resident Aliens.</li>
<li><strong>Texas Credits:</strong>  Texas has a limited number of tax credits.  Research for any relevant credits for Non-Resident Aliens.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. State-Specific Tax Optimizations (Texas):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Texas Franchise Tax:</strong>  If Samuel Will operates a business in Texas, the franchise tax needs to be factored in.  The tax is based on revenue and margin.</li>
<li><strong>Property Taxes:</strong>  Review property tax implications for any real estate holdings in Texas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Tax-Loss Harvesting Opportunities:</strong></p>
<p>The provided portfolio shows several assets with capital gains.  However,  "A. O. Smith" (AOS) shows a loss.  A detailed analysis of the purchase dates and cost basis of all assets is necessary to determine the specific tax loss harvesting opportunities.  If applicable, selling AOS and reinvesting into a similar asset can generate a tax loss to offset capital gains.</p>

It's imperative to consult a qualified tax professional specializing in Non-Resident Alien taxation and Texas state taxes for tailored recommendations based on Samuel Will's complete financial picture and current tax laws.</p>
