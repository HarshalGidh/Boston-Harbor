<h2>2. Deductions, Exemptions, and Credits</h2>
<p><strong>Federal Deductions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Itemized Deductions:</strong>  Samuel should itemize if the total exceeds the standard deduction.  Potentially deductible items include home mortgage interest (if applicable), state and local taxes (SALT deduction limited to $10,000), charitable contributions, and investment interest expense.</li>
<li><strong>Standard Deduction:</strong>  The standard deduction amount depends on filing status (married filing jointly).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Texas Deductions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Homestead Exemption:</strong>  A significant reduction in property taxes on a primary residence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Federal Credits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Saver's Credit):</strong>  A credit for taxpayers with modest incomes contributing to retirement accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Texas Credits:</strong></p>

</ul>
<h2>3. State-Specific Tax Optimizations (Texas)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Texas Franchise Tax:</strong>  The franchise tax applies to businesses in Texas.  Strategies to minimize this tax should be explored if Samuel's business is incorporated.</li>
<li><strong>Property Taxes:</strong>  The homestead exemption is crucial for lowering property taxes.  Exploring other property tax relief programs is also advisable.</li>
<li><strong>Sales Tax:</strong>  There is no state income tax in Texas, but sales tax applies to various purchases. Strategize to minimize sales tax where applicable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Tax-Loss Harvesting Opportunities</h2>
<p>The provided portfolio shows both gains and losses. Tax-loss harvesting should be implemented to offset capital gains, thus reducing tax liability. The strategy should consider the wash-sale rule, which prevents deducting losses if similar securities are purchased within a 30-day period before or after the sale. A financial advisor can help to make the best choices.</p>
