**3. State-Specific Tax Optimizations (Texas)**

Texas is a relatively low-tax state with no individual income tax. However, there are other taxes to consider:

* **Sales Tax:**  Be mindful of sales tax implications on purchases.
* **Property Tax:**  Understanding property tax exemptions and deductions is vital for homeowners.
* **Franchise Tax:** Relevant to businesses rather than individuals.

**4. Tax-Loss Harvesting Opportunities**

Since no investment portfolio is available, this aspect is currently not applicable.  Tax-loss harvesting involves selling losing investments to offset capital gains.
