<p><strong>1. Investment Strategies for Tax Efficiency:</strong></p>
<p>The absence of current investments allows for proactive planning.  Future investments should consider tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tax-loss harvesting:</strong>  While no current losses are indicated, this strategy involves selling losing investments to offset capital gains, reducing taxable income.  This will be relevant once investments are made.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend reinvestment:</strong> Reinvesting dividends in the same company or fund defers tax liability until the shares are sold.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Deductions, Exemptions, and Credits:</strong></p>
<p>With limited financial information, only general deductions can be considered.</p>

<p><strong>3. State-Specific Tax Optimizations (Texas):</strong></p>
<p>Texas has no state income tax.  This significantly reduces overall tax liability.  However, property taxes and sales taxes apply.  Future real estate purchases need to factor these into considerations.</p>
<p><strong>4. Tax-Loss Harvesting Opportunities:</strong></p>
<p>No tax-loss harvesting opportunities exist currently due to the absence of an investment portfolio.</p>
