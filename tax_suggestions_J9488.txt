<h3>2. Deductions, Exemptions, and Credits</h3>
<p><strong>Federal Deductions (Examples):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Deduction:</strong>  A standard amount that can be deducted, dependent on filing status.</li>
<li><strong>Itemized Deductions:</strong>  Deductions for specific expenses (mortgage interest, charitable contributions, etc.)â€”only if they exceed the standard deduction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Texas Deductions (Examples):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Texas does not have an income tax.  Therefore, deductions related to federal income tax are not relevant.  However, property taxes may be deductible depending on other factors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Credits (Examples):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Child Tax Credit (Federal):</strong>  A credit for qualifying children.  The availability and amount depend on income and other factors.  </li>
<li><strong>Earned Income Tax Credit (Federal):</strong>  A credit for low- to moderate-income working individuals and families.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  Eligibility for deductions and credits depends on individual circumstances and income levels.</p>
<h3>3. State-Specific Tax Optimizations (Texas)</h3>
<p>Texas does not have a state income tax.  However, property taxes and sales taxes are significant.  Strategies to minimize these include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Property Tax Exemptions:</strong>  Explore homestead exemptions and other potential exemptions to reduce property taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Sales Tax Awareness:</strong>  Being aware of sales tax rates and taking advantage of sales tax holidays can help minimize sales tax burden.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Tax-Loss Harvesting Opportunities</h3>
<p>Since there are no investments reported, there are currently no tax-loss harvesting opportunities to exploit.  Tax-loss harvesting involves selling investments that have lost value to offset capital gains.  This requires having capital gains to offset.</p>
